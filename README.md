# Greenwashing_Detector_Web_Extension-
Greenwashing Detector is an AI-powered web application designed to analyze and identify potentially misleading environmental and sustainability claims made by companies across websites and marketing content.

The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) using a pre-trained ClimateBERT environmental-claims model to classify text and detect greenwashing indicators based on semantic patterns and sustainability buzzwords.

Built a Flask-based backend API that extracts website content, performs automated claim analysis, generates downloadable audit-style reports, and supports real-time interaction with a browser extension.

Integrated fact-checking logic, text preprocessing, and report generation, enabling transparent evaluation of environmental claims and improving user awareness of misleading sustainability practices.
